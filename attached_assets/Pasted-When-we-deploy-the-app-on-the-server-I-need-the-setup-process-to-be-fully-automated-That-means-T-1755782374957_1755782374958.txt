When we deploy the app on the server, I need the setup process to be fully automated. That means:

The database schema and initial data should be created automatically during installation or first run (migration/seeding system).

No manual SQL setup â€” it should handle itself like production-ready Node.js apps.

Data integrity and security must be guaranteed (transactions, proper indexing, no risk of data loss on restart).

The app must come with a secure admin panel out of the box for managing content, users, and settings.

Deployment should be as simple as running the app, not multiple manual steps.

Backup Strategy for Production Apps

Automated Backups

Database backups should run daily (or more often if needed).

Use database tools like:

mysqldump / pg_dump (for MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Built-in snapshot features if using cloud DB (AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, etc.)

Backups should be stored off-server (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze, etc.), not only on the same machine.

Incremental Backups for Large Data

For big apps, they donâ€™t just dump the whole DB daily â€” they keep incremental backups (only changes since the last backup). This saves space and speeds up restore.

Encryption & Security

Backup files should be encrypted before upload.

Only the server/admin should have access keys to restore.

Versioning & Retention Policy

Keep multiple versions of backups (e.g., last 7 days daily, last 4 weeks weekly, last 12 months monthly).

This way if corruption goes unnoticed for days, you can still restore from an older safe copy.

Restore Process (Disaster Recovery)

Restoring should be as simple as:

Spin up a new server.

Pull the latest code.

Run migrations (if needed).

Import the latest backup file.

Big websites always test restores regularly â€” a backup is useless if you never tested restoring it.

Application Data & Files

Not just DB â€” also back up user-uploaded files (images, videos, documents).

Usually done by syncing uploads folder to S3 or another cloud storage provider.

ðŸ‘‰ So when you talk to your dev, tell him you want:

Automatic scheduled DB backups (daily + incremental).

Secure offsite storage (S3 or equivalent).

Easy restore scripts (so even if server dies, you can get everything back quickly).

Periodic restore tests to confirm backups actually work.
